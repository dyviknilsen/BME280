BME280 Indoor Climate Presentation Page by Jonas Dyvik Nilsen v1.0, February 2nd 2019

This web page was created as a school project to display the results from a BME280 sensor unit, connected to an ESP32 microcontroller running MicroPython.

Features:
	- Displays three sensor values in written and visual form, together with a dynamic color and written statement that changes based on the result.
	- Failsafe system to keep the progression bars from becoming too large or too small. The bar will always stay between 1% and 100%.
	- Dynamic web page that adapts to the screen size.
	- Refresh button to easily update the results.
	- 5 second automatic refresh commented out in the HTML document.
	- Separate CSS document and favicon folder located on the https://dyviknilsen.no domain. Files included in separate folder.
